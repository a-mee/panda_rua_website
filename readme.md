- Make use of both inline and block elements:<br> 
Block elements were specifically used for the navbar and the footer and inline for the back button on the item page


#### Some additional Features used:

- The website is responsive in the following ways:
	- The navigation bar: when the screen gets small it changes from a row to a column.
	- The home page: if someone is viewing on a smaller screen it will display an image instead of the background video (incase they are using mobile data, so they wonâ€™t be charged to view the video).
	- The gallery page: the margin gets smaller on a smaller screen.
- A form is used on the about us page.
- CSS grid is used on the gallery page and when you hover over each image the opacity and the curser both change, and when you click an image the grid changes and that clicked image becomes larger.
- On the item page when you hover over the smaller images the order of the grid changes and they become the larger image.
